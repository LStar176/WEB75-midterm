## Final Feedback

**You've shown a commendable effort in this project. Your ability to follow instructions and understand documentation is impressive. Your hard work is evident in the progress you've made. However, there are a few areas that need improvement. Pay attention to details like spell checking your answers and handling errors properly. Also, ensure you're not passing the `req.body` directly to the update function for security reasons. Your authentication section needs some work, but don't be discouraged. These are all part of the learning process. Keep up the hard work, and you'll continue to improve!**
